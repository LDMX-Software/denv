.PP
Develop code in identical command line interface environments across
different container managers and their runners.

Containerization of code has only grown in popularity since it (almost)
completely removes issues of dependency incompatibility.
More recently, even developing code within a container has grown in
popularity leading to several approaches.
.PP
The main problem I have with all of these is lack of support for my
specific workflow.
I not only use my personal computer (with docker or podman) but I also
commonly use academic High Performance Computers (HPCs) which tend to
have apptainer or singularity installed due to their better support for
security-focused (lack of user access) installations.
This is the main origin for \f[C]denv\f[R] - provide a common interface
for using images as a development environment across these four
container managers.
.IP \[bu] 2
distrobox (https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox): main inspiration for
denv, POSIX-sh program with a larger feature set than denv but currently
restricted to docker or podman
.IP \[bu] 2
VS Code
devcontainers (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers):
designed to be used in conjuction with the VS Code IDE, also currently
restricted to docker (or podman with some tweaking)
.IP \[bu] 2
devbox (https://github.com/jetpack-io/devbox): \[lq]similar to a package
manager \&... except the packages it manages are at the operating-system
level\[rq], a helpful tool based on \f[C]nix\f[R], written in
\f[C]go\f[R]

This is the newest project and probably most closely aligned to my
goals; however, it would require understanding how to write NixPkgs for
all my dependencies (which is not an easy task given how specialized so
many of the packages are) and I am not currently able to functionally
install it on the HPCs which use apptainer/singularity.

toolbox (https://github.com/containers/toolbox): built on top of
\f[C]podman\f[R], similar in spirit to distrobox and devbox
