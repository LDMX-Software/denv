.SH INSTALLATION
.SS curl
.PP
If you trust me (or have proofread the install script), you can install
dbx with a one-liner.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomeichlersmith/dbx/main/install | sh 
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
By default, this installs dbx to \[ti]/.local if you are a non-root
user.
You can define the install prefix (\[en]prefix dir) and choose to use
the HEAD of the main branch rather than the last release (\[en]next)
both of which are optional.

curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomeichlersmith/dbx/main/install | \[rs]
  sh -s -- --prefix dir --next

.SH CONTRIBUTING
.PP
Feel free to create a fork of https://github.com/tomeichlersmith/dbx and
open a Pull Request with any bug patches or feature improvements.
We aim to keep dbx as a single file with optional completion and manual
files in parallel.
Check that dbx is still POSIX with dash.

\f[C]
dash -n dbx

Install shellcheck from https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck and use
it to make sure dbx avoids common shell scripting errors.
